      "\n",
      "Wether the function is an image, a curve or a surface, wavelets are a time frequency transform that allows to represent a function with different levels of details.\n",
      "Often used in computer graphics problems such as image compression, or image querying, Haar Wavelets transformation play an important role in audio processing.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Haar Wavelet transformation consists in decomposing a function in the Haar wavelets basis.\n",
      "We will first take a look at one-dimensional Haar Wavelet transform, then move on to two-dimensional Wavelet transform and how we apply it to an image.\n",

      "Let\u2019s consider a one-dimensional image : It can be seen as a vector of pixels. Each pixel has a value between 0 and 255.\n",
      "Alternatively, this image can be represented as a piecewise-constant functions on the interval [0,1[.\n",
      "\n",
      "A one pixel image is a function that is constant over the entire interval  [0,1[. Let $V^{0}$ be the vector space of all these functions.\n",
      "\n",
      "A two pixel image has two constant pieces over the interval [0,1/2[, and [1/2,1[. We will call this vector space $V^{1}$. Recursively, we create the space $V^{j}$, for images with $2^{j}$ pixels.\n",
      "We want to build a basis for the vector space $V^{j}$. To do so, we choose the following functions :\n",
      "\n",

A collection of linearly independent functions $\\gamma_{i}^{j}$ spanning $W^{j}$ are called wavelets.\n",

To do so, we only **keep the strongest wavelets among all the wavelets (magnitude wise)** : We only keep the ones that most characterize the image. These wavelets are called the top-t wavelets.\n",
